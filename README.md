# What is Yallah-Ride?

Same as hitchhiking idea which is used to get a lift with passing vehicles when travelling, and with the use of applications, we can provide through Yallah-Ride a more secure and a safer way than hitchhiking.

# Why Yallah-Ride  

* Provide alternative ride for people than using a bus, a train, or a taxi.
* Reducing the cost, as the ride cost will split on both driver and rider, even there would be an option if the driver only wants to have company so offers a free ride.
* You will have the chance to meet friendly people on the application, which then would give you a life time friendship!
* Reducing the pollution and saving the environment 
* Decreasing the use of cars which will reduce the traffic, as well as it will help to reduce the pollutant emission.
